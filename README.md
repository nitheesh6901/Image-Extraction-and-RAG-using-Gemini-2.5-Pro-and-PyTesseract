# Image-Extraction-and-RAG-using-Gemini-2.5-Pro-and-PyTesseract
This project demonstrates an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that extracts text from images using PyTesseract (OCR) and combines it with Google’s Gemini 2.5-Pro LLM to generate intelligent, context-based responses.
